Amazon Helpfulness Prediction and Topic modelling

Used amazon electronics reviews dataset 

-Predicted helpfulness of the reviews to understand how review quality affects customers buying decisions and assist sellers/e-commerce sites make informed decisions. Used Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine Classification Techniques. Naïve Bayes model gave an accuracy of only 45%. Hence decided to use Support Vector Machine which can handle a dataset of large size. With the motive of getting a higher accuracy used derived additional features such as Strong count, symbol count, sentence count, top 100 unigrams and used them to predict the helpfulness of reviews.
-Implemented topic modelling using LDA to extract key insights from huge chunk of review data without having to go through them. The LDA Model helped us to understand the review text better.
